        <h2>How to play?</h2>
        <p>
          You will get two random numbers, each between 1-12, as well as a
          random sign and your goal is to answer as many equations as possible!
          Then you can share your score with your friends and family to see who
          scored the highest!
        </p>

        <h2>Why build this?</h2>
        <p>
          We want to bring the fun back in Math!! One evening we were sitting
          around looking at games on the internet (wordle, chess, sudoku) but
          found nothing for math. Reminiscing on our childhood days when we
          played the Mad Minute in math class, we decided to create an online
          version for ourselves! Now we’ve decided to launch it to all, enjoy!
          :)
        </p>

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p>
          Alllowing the user to pick the difficulty of equations they want to
          play on, currently our standard mode is available.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tournament mode, you can create/join a bracket style tournament where
          you go head to head with up to 16 people until one is named the
          champ!!
        </p>

        <p>
          Analytics to help you track your progress! This feature will allow you
          to see what equations you most frequently miss and what signs you can
          improve on. Parents can better understand their children’s math skills
          and areas of improvement!
